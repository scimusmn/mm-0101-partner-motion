# Math Moves - 0101 - Partner Motion

## Install instructions

This project does not require any files from this Git repository. This README.md is the only file here!


If starting with a fresh out-of-box machine, start with the [official exhibit computer setup](http://projects.smm.org/atrium/media/node/280246).  

Once base Boxen has successfully been installed, you should be ready to run the custom Partner Motion install.

    boxen mm_0101_partner_motion
    
After the process completes, go to System Preferences > Cursorcerer. Set "Hide idle cursor after" to 5 seconds.

## Run the application
The application should start correctly after rebooting the computer.

## Hardware Note
This is a legacy application that does not run fullscreen and unfortunately displays a menu bar. Therefore, the screen being used must either offset 60px via settings, or the cabinet must be built to cover the menu bar with a lip.
