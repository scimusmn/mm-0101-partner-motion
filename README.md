# Math Moves - 0101 - Partner Motion

## Automatic install instructions

You can install this application using the private SMM Boxen repo. This requires an internal SMM account.
First, install the basic boxen repo, using our [Boxen setup script](https://github.com/scimusmn/boxen-setup). 
Once the Boxen script has run through without errors, you can run the custom Partner Motion install.
